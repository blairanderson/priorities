# Get detailed reports and alerts for your Amazon accounts.

<span class="">Hi there!</span> I'm [Blair Anderson](https://www.blairanderson.co/) and like you, I'm responsible for pushing Amazon **sales** _(and profits)_ up and to the right on <u class="amazon">Amazon</u>!

My humble team currently manages roughly $30m/year across _VendorCentral_ and _SellerCentral_ accounts. Our accounts under management have grossed well over $300m since we started helping customers sell on Amazon.

eCommerce sales & marketing is _significantly_ different than traditional retail, and like you, I track a variety of data points while maintaining a broad reach of responsibilities.

## We build tools for Vendors, Sellers, and Agencies

### **Email Attachment** -> **EDI Inventory**

*   New Product Launches.
*   Inventory Forecasting.
*   Keeping <span class="underline amazon"><span class="near-black">Amazon</span></span> <span class="fw9">In-Stock</span>.
*   Reducing & Preventing Logistics problems.
*   Basically Optimizing the Overall Customer Experience!

And like you, I work hard to stay on top of business, this is **our job** after all!

But you and I both know there is a never-ending list of stuff that needs to be managed to win on the <span class="underline amazon"><span class="near-black">Amazon</span></span> platform:

*   How are **Product Reviews** Recently?
*   Can we fix our **product packaging**?
*   Did you know we lost the **Buy Box**?
*   **Incoming** product shipments
*   **Outgoing** product shipments
*   Product marketing photos and videos
*   Product Variations
*   A+ pages
*   Compliance issues
*   Invoices / Accounts receivable

I try to hire the best employees possible to support me, but at the end of the day, I'm responsible for making sure each job is completed to a high standard.

Our goal is to become your next employee for a fraction of the cost:

*   You don't need to train us. We are humans with robots.
*   You will probably learn things using our toolset
*   We are automated and on-time. Your weekly email will not be forgotten.
*   Get your reports emailed as you want them.
