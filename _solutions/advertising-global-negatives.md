title: Advertising Global Negative Bids
action: "Setup negative exact keywords once, we'll push them to every new campaign that you create"
goal: "Campaign-specific keywords are normal part of the process, but the most annoying thing is needing to remember those Account-wide Negatives that are always added to all campaigns. We keep track and push them to all your campaigns."
